# EpochTime
This is a simple bridge between .NET's System.DateTime and Unix time.

## Unix Time
Unix time is measured by counting the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC (the Unix epoch). Please see [the Wikipedia article on Unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time "Unix time") for more information.

### Milliseconds
This lib also supports milliseconds.
